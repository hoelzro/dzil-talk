- Dist::Zilla character thing

- I was afraid; afraid people would say my code would suck, afraid I'd miss some small detail about packaging things up.
- Regarding the first fear, I eventually figured that my first couple modules might suck, but knowing the Perl community,
  I'd probably get useful feedback.  That's how you grow.
- Regarding the second, I figured the only way to get all of the details down is to do a bunch of module releases; it's okay
  if it's not perfect.
- So I released a couple of modules...
- Releasing modules isn't *hard*, but there's a lot of tedium that goes into it.

- This is how I did my first few modules.
- But then I remembered Dist::Zilla, which I had heard about last year, but didn't seem that relevant, since I wasn't a module author.
- I decided the next module I wrote would use Dist::Zilla for packaging.
- Mention predecessors/alternatives:
 - ShipIt
 - Module::Starter
