- Dist::Zilla - distribution swiss army knife
- Dist::Zilla character thing

- How many of you have released a module on the CPAN?
- For those of you who haven't, why not?
- I learned Perl in 2006, and yet I released my first module to the CPAN just this past January.
- Why?
- Fear is the <strike>mind</strike> module killer!
- I was afraid; afraid people would say my code would suck, afraid I'd miss some small detail about packaging things up.
- Regarding the first fear, I eventually figured that my first couple modules might suck, but knowing the Perl community,
  I'd probably get useful feedback.  That's how you grow.
- Regarding the second, I figured the only way to get all of the details down is to do a bunch of module releases; it's okay
  if it's not perfect.
- So I released a couple of modules...
- Releasing modules isn't *hard*, but there's a lot of tedium that goes into it.
    - Writing (good) tests. (you *are* writing tests, right?)
    - Writing code that passes those tests.
    - Maintaining your Changes file.
    - Maintaining your README file.
    - Maintaining your LICENSE file.
    - Maintaining your MANIFEST file.
    - Maintaining your documentation.
    - Maintaining your Makefile.PL/Build.PL.
    - Maintaining your META.yml/META.json.
    - Making sure all of your versions match.
- And you have to remember to do all of these things for every release of every distribution you write.

- To quote the ShipIt distribution: "This is all a pain in the ass."
- This is how I did my first few modules.
- But then I remembered Dist::Zilla, which I had heard about last year, but didn't seem that relevant, since I wasn't a module author.
- I decided the next module I wrote would use Dist::Zilla for packaging.
- Mention predecessors/alternatives:
 - ShipIt
 - Module::Starter
