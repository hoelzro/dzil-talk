What is Dist::Zilla?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
"Dist::Zilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the CPAN." \\
\pause
Yeah, so what!  So does MakeMaker!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Dist::Zilla goes a step further.  It generates MakeMaker input for you, among
many, many other things:

\begin{itemize}
\pause \item Seeds your distribution with common tests.
\pause \item Generates a README.
\pause \item Helps you to maintain a Changes file.
\pause \item Manages your MANIFEST and LICENSE files.
\pause \item Tags and pushes releases to your revision control system.
\pause \item Uploads your release to CPAN.
\pause \item Manages your META.yml/META.json for you.
\pause \item Detects your distribution's prerequisites.
\pause \item Verifies that your distribution's prerequisites are correct.
\pause \item Weaves common POD into your modules (like license information, bug reporting information, author name, etc)
\end{itemize}

\pause 
And much, much more!
