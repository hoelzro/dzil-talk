Dist::Zilla goes a step further than other tools like MakeMaker.  It can generate MakeMaker input for you, among
many, many other things:

\begin{itemize}
\pause \item Seeds your distribution with common tests.
\pause \item Generates a README.
\pause \item Helps you to maintain a Changes file.
\pause \item Manages your MANIFEST and LICENSE files.
\pause \item Tags and pushes releases to your revision control system.
\pause \item Manages your META.yml/META.json for you.
\pause \item Manages your distribution's prerequisites.
\pause \item Uploads your release to CPAN.
\pause \item Weaves common POD into your modules.
\end{itemize}

\pause
And much, much more!
