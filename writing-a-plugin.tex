\commentary{Dist::Zilla is written using Moose, so to write a plugin, you create a Moose class that consumes one or more roles.}
\commentary{Dist::Zilla does almost everything in terms of plugins; commands, the user interface, dist minting, dist building, etc.}
\commentary{Long story short: there are a \emph{lot} of roles in Dist::Zilla.  We're only going to cover a handful here.}
\commentary{Each role is based off of Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin.}
\commentary{If you want to implement a plugin bundle, you can consume the Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle role.}

\begin{itemslide}{Plugin Order for Build}
\item BeforeBuild
\item FileGatherer
\item FilePruner
\item FileMunger
\item PrereqSource
\item MetaProvider
\item InstallTool
\item AfterBuild
\end{itemslide}

In addition to the previous plugins being run, the \emph{test} and \emph{release} commands
have their own lifecycle roles, namely TestRunner in the case of the former, and BeforeRelease, Releaser, and AfterRelease in
the case of the latter.
