% Before we begin, I'd like a show of hands...
% How many of you have written a Perl module?
% How many of you have released one to the CPAN?
% How many of you maintain a DarkPAN?
% Whether you've never released a module to the CPAN or you've released twenty, or whether or not you intend to release a module there ever again, this talk should benefit you, as long as you're doing some sort of build or deployment automation.
% For those of you who have written modules, but never released them to the CPAN...Why not?
% A bit of background about myself...
% I learned Perl in 2006, and yet I didn't release my first module to the CPAN until this past January.  Why not?

\LARGE{Truth is, there's a lot that goes into releasing a module!}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\pause \item Writing (good) tests. (you \textit{are} writing tests, right?)
\pause \item Writing code that passes those tests.
\pause \item Maintaining your Changes file.
\pause \item Maintaining your README file.
\pause \item Maintaining your LICENSE file.
\pause \item Maintaining your MANIFEST file.
\pause \item Maintaining your documentation.
\pause \item Maintaining your Makefile.PL/Build.PL.
\pause \item Maintaining your META.yml/META.json. % This is something I screwed up the first time!
\pause \item Making sure all of your versions match.
\end{itemize}

\pause

And you have to remember to do all of these things for every single release of every distribution you write.
